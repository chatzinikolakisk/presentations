Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing thoughts on software engineering, technology, leadership, and the messy, beautiful reality of life itself.

## What You Can Expect

- Technical deep dives into interesting problems
- Insights from engineering leadership and team building
- Reflections on industry trends and best practices
- Personal stories, slice-of-life moments, and random musings
- Updates on projects and presentations
- The occasional overthought analysis of everyday things

## About This Site

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The presentations section uses Reveal.js for interactive tech talks, while the blog uses simple Markdown for easy writing and maintenance.
